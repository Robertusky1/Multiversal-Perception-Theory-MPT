# Multiversal-Perception-Theory-MPT
The Multiversal Perception Theory (MPT) proposes that time, space, motion, and gravity are not intrinsic properties but perceptual phenomena emerging from interactions within a static, bidimensional multiversal network. This theory integrates principles of quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and advanced mathematics.
